Data Stored to Local Storage in the following table structure
- portfolio
- transaction 
- wallet

Self imposed restrictions
- The whole project is completed in a single page, it could have been divided into multiple pages.
- Styling is only implemented according to the basic requirements, no beautificaiton is done.
- Profit and Loss is calculated on basis of the initial balance not on day by day basis or invested and realised gains/losses basis.
- Code structure is not broken down into components.

All the above as there was no criteria given for evaluation. If given any criteria for what I will be judged on then i can make those optimization and improvements in the code or the UI or time/space complexity accordingly. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
